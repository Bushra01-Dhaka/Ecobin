# ♻️ ECOBIN – Smart Waste Management Web Application

ECOBIN is a smart, role-based waste management web application developed as a **Final Year Project**.  
It aims to modernize waste collection, tracking, reuse, and coordination through a centralized digital platform.

The system introduces a **Mutual Benefit Program (MBP)** that connects waste holders with landowners and construction & demolition (C&D) companies using a post and bidding system—turning waste into opportunity.
